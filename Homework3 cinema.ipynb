        "    implied than manifest. The Shining is a truly frightening movie that works symbolically on many levels, but is basically \\\n",
        "    about human shortcomings and the way they can be exploited by unconscious forces combined with weakness of will.\\\n",
        "     This film scares the most just by using suggestion to turn your own imagination against you. The Shining is a\\\n",
